# varnamd
=============

Varnam daemon which also acts as a HTTP server. This program powers http://varnamproject.com

### Installation

You do not have to git clone the repo. Use the following command to clone and install varnamd:

`go get github.com/varnamproject/varnamd`

You need to have set the [$GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) environment variable for this to work. Do not worry about the directory structure since it will be created for you by the previous `go get`.

`cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/varnamproject/varnamd`

`go install`

The binaries should now be present in `$GOPATH/bin/`

`./$GOPATH/bin/varnamd` to run the server
